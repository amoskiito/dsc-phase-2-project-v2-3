# Phase 2 Project Description

![](download.jpg)

The housing market is booming and the demand to create more housing is higher than ever. I have been tasked by Kraken Construction, a new housing developer in King County, WA to assess the local housing market and identify the features that most influence home sale price.

Stakeholder: Alliance Realtors

Business Problem: Housing developers would like to build homes including features that will contribute to a higher sale price of the home.

Business Question: What features should you consider when building a new home that would ultimately lead to a higher sale price?

Performing multiple linear regression on past home sales can show how strong of a relationship there is between the sale price of a home and a particular feature. Knowing to what extent these features influence sale price can provide insight and confidence that your new renovation will not only be a desirable build but one that will sell at a price you feel comfortable with.
